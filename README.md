# DeltaCals
Python calculators for delta 3D printers
Written in Python for the sake of my capstone project, they provide numerical data to aid a design and evaluation of a design.
For now only a full calculator that's meant to calculate final uncertainty, with more to come, as I need to translate and rework sections of the code.

Special thanks to [Oliof](https://github.com/oliof/) and [Eponra](https://github.com/eponra/) for encouragement and limiting my scope creep.
