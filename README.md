# DeltaCals
Python calculators for delta 3D printers
Written in Python for the sake of my capstone project, they provide numerical data and pretty graphs to aid a design and evaluation of a design.
Calculators output jpg images with name of the used calculator, date and time.

# Existing calculators:
- **deltaforces_eng.py** - calculates static and dynamic forces acting on a drive, meant to help with selecting steppers to hit given acceleration for given geometry.
- **deltafull_eng.py** - calculates delta static positioning error, taking into account stepper characteristics, delta geometry and masses of components.
